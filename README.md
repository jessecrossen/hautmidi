# HAUT MIDI
This is a collection of experimental MIDI input devices I'm working on. The Wild West of the MIDI protocol 
still hasn't been fully explored, and scores are settled with [cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) 
and [keytars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keytar)...

# Joysticks!

A quick and easy way to start making interesting MIDI signals is to use a joystick or joystick-compatible 
device mapped to MIDI with my [joy2midi](joy2midi/README.md) utility. I've tried it with a [gaming joystick](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009OY9U), but there are more exotic options like 
[3D mice](http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacemouse.html), which act like 6-axis joysticks.
All the controllers for the [RockBand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band_%28video_game%29)
game are actually just joysticks with interesting shapes. There are probably many more out there
if you look.
